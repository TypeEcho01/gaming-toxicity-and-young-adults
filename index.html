				<h1>Gaming Toxicity and Young Adults</h1>
				<h3>How toxicity in online competitve games affects the self esteem and anxiety of adults aged 18-25</h3>
			</header>

			<main>
				<section>
					<p>
						Toxicity in online competitve games is often said to be a non issue; 
						people brush it off as simply a part of gaming that people either need to get used to or stop playing. 
						However, prolonged toxicity has serious long term effects on people, 
						especially for young adults whose brains have yet to fully developed. 
						I hope that this website can convince you of the seriousness of toxicity in online competitve games, 
						how the effects it has on self esteem and anxiety, particurally for young adults, is a problem that 
						cannot be ignored, and what we, both as gamers and game developers, can do to combat toxicity.

						<p>
							Dr. Alok, a licensed doctor in the United States, from HealthyGamerGG made a video on what happens to those who play video games for an extended period of time. 
							He claims that people who play games extensively can become alexithymic, meaning they struggle to recognize or process their emotions. 
							Those who suppress their emotions while gaming won't feel the blow of toxic interactions in the moment, 
							but will have it catch up with them eventually, lowering their self esteem and their ability to regulate their emotions in the long run. 
						</p>

						<p>
							This reaction delay complicates how toxicity is perceived by people. 
							Some end up underestimating why toxicity is so bad or failing to recognize how it affects their well being 
							because they attribute their negative emotions they feel so long after gaming to something else in their lives.
							I can personally relate to becoming alexithymic, as I have played competitve games for a very long time, 
							and I've also had trouble processing my emotions. I can also relate to feeling impartial to toxicity in game, 
							but feeling the brunt of it after the game is over.
						</p>

						<p>
							This video, along with my personal experience, illustrates how continously playing video games make you less vulnerable 
							to feeling negative emotions. Why does this matter? If you have trouble processing negativity from toxicity, you are 
							both more likely to brush off toxicity as nothing serious, and even participate in toxicity yourself as you can justify it 
							as just playful banter that won't hurt people as it doesn't hurt you.

					<button id="button1">Why Toxicity Matters</button>

					<div id="expandable1">					
						<p>
							How does toxicity impact you and your mental health, and why does it matter? Online games are a fantastic way to connect with others and even make friends, 
							yet the overwhelming amount of toxicity that plagues competitive gaming communities begs the question of 
							if gaming's social benefits outweigh the downsides it has on mental health. Toxicity negatively impacts people's social capital, relatedness, 
							and emotional well being, proving that gaming toxicity causes mental health issues like anxiety and self esteem struggles. 
							Young adults are particurally susceptible to this, as their brains are still developing.
						</p>

						<p>
							The argument that toxicity diminishes the social benefits of gaming is a strong one. 
							Frommel et al. found that players who perceive their communities as toxic claim to not only have lower satisfaction in their social connections, 
							but also increased loneliness, suggesting that, while multiplayer games do create valuable opportunities for real positive connection, 
							too many interactions are often hurtful and discouraging rather than helpful and uplifting. A big reason for this, as the authors point out, 
							is that every individual has their own perspective on what counts as toxicity, meaning that harmful behaviors, 
							such as using in-game text or voice chat to call people names, can be normalized or excused. 
							This normalization allows toxicity to keep happening, even among players who don't see themselves as part of the problem. 
							While some players continue gaming despite toxic interactions, their mental and social health still suffer as a result of this phenomena.
						</p>

						<p>
							One of the aspects about gaming toxicity that concerns me the most is its effects on self esteem. 
							People who continuously get bombarded with negativity internalize it, specifically in competitive games where the prime focus is on performance and winning. 
							This can spark a self destructive cycle where people keep playing despite the toxicity because they're desensitized to the negativity, 
							digging themselves deeper into the toxic rabbit hole and spiraling further into a depression.

					<button id="button2">Toxicity Targets Minorities And Women</button>

					<div id="expandable2">					
						<p>
							Gaming should be a haven for everyone, not just who society deems acceptable to participate, 
							yet toxic players in online games tend to target women and minority groups such as people of color and LGBTQ+ people. 
							In Understanding Toxicity in Online Gaming, Maharani et al. highlight how female players in the popular competitive shooter game Valorant 
							feel discouraged from using in-game voice chat due to the fear of verbal harassment. 
							It's clear when a feature necessary for winning at a high level is being avoided out of fear from the game's community that toxicity is running rampant. 
							This fear builds up and gradually chips away at self esteem, as women become less and less comfortable and confident in themselves and their voice, 
							regardless of their performance in the game.
						</p>

						<p>
							The article Analyzing Toxicity in Online Gaming Communities by Ghosh talks about how being behind a screen provides a level of anonymity 
							that allows people to remove themselves from what they're saying and thereby justify toxicity. 
							When combined with the natural frustration that competitive environments foster, 
							toxicity becomes more easy and justifiable than it ever could be in person. 
							This leads to the normalization of toxicity, which further justifies toxicity and makes it more difficult to break the cycle, 
							both for the harassers and the victims. When toxicity becomes normalized, people affected have less of a reason to talk about it, 
							and it builds up so much that it begins to affect their lives out of the game in the form of anxiety.
						</p>

						<p>
							The impact toxicity has on mental health is bigger than it ever could be on an individual level; 
							it harms the overall gaming community and fosters a “boys club” and exclusionary environment. 
							If players, namely women and minorities, feel unwelcome from playing games due to toxicity, 
							and experience anxiety and self esteem issues because of it, it becomes more and more difficult to fix these issues. 
							The more toxicity there is against these groups leads to them leaving, causing less diversity and further entrenching the same cycle pushing them away. 
							More importantly, if young adults associate competitive gaming with negativity and hate, 
							it can affect their view of allS competitive environments and affect their confidence in their work.

					<button id="button3">Systemic Toxicity</button>

					<div id="expandable3">					
						<p>
							Toxicity in online games isn't something that only matters in game; 
							it's a systemic issue that has harmed people's mental health and will continue to unless a large, sweeping change occurs. 
							It is clear that toxicity has become dismissed as simply a part of gaming, and people's own experiences prove this. 
							Josh Garth recounted his experience with the League of Legends community's worst, 
							as he stopped playing the game permanently after someone threated to rape his mother using in game communications. 
							This isn't something that can be brushed off as casual banter or competitive trash talking; 
							this vile threat is something that wouldn't be appropriate to say in any context. 
						</p>

						<p>
							Garth isn't alone in his decision to stop playing League of Legends due to the community, especially after experiencing such extreme harassment. 
							The Antidefamation League's survey reveals that 22% of players have quit certain games due to being harassed. 
							One fifth of players quitting in these situations is significant, 
							as it reflects how something preventable is causing so many to stop something that may give them joy otherwise. 
							Their survey also shows that a staggering 81% of players have experienced harassment of some kind. 
							This highlights how widespread of an issue toxicity is, which is one reason it is easier to normalize.
						</p>

						<p>
							MagiWasTaken adds an insightful layer to the conversation at hand, not just focusing on the essence of toxicity, 
							but also how it is rationalized by players. 
							The author argues that people often feel a sense of entitlement to treat others with disrespect when they get frustrated or suffer losses. 
							This is how they justify the morals of toxicity towards others. Said sense of entitlement sparks a cycle: 
							toxic behavior leads to more toxic behavior, leading to its normalization. 
							People internalize toxicity as just another part of online gaming and interaction, they become less likely to report it or speak out against it. 
							In the worst case scenario, they join the cycle themselves.
						</p>

						<p>
							Despite their differences, both of these authors agree that gaming toxicity isn't simply a few bad sports. It's a cultural issue, a structural issue, 
							and it's affecting the mental health of countless people. People who enjoy games shouldn't need to sacrifice playing them just to avoid a toxic community. 
							If the gaming world wants to become more inclusive, then both gaming communities and developers need to band together to fight toxicity.

					<button id="button5">What You Can Do To Help</button>

					<div id="expandable5">					
						<p>
							Although all of the authors that I've cited in the previous sections are different people with different life experiences, 
							most of them expressed a desire for the video game community, developers, or both to make a change. 
							While the effects of prolonged toxicity have a large effect on anxiety and self esteem of young adults, not all hope is lost. 
							You may be wondering what you can do to help stop toxicity from continuing to plague our games.
						</p>

						<p>
							Developers should continue to foster a healthy gaming environment in their communities, 
							whether that's by simply improving reporting systems, or making their game clearly a space for women and minorities. 
							No matter what, the more developers encourage everyone to get along, the more likely players will follow suit.
						</p>

						<p>
							Ultimately, this issue isn't something that can be fixed by one person, or even one group. 
							It requires an active effort by both the entire video game community and developers. 
							Developers can put all their effort in putting in systems to combat toxicity, but if players continue to be toxic, 
							their efforts won't put a dent in the issue. Likewise, if players advocate for a healtier community, but the developers 
							don't place any attention on the same issue, then player efforts will likely fall short. 
							Both parties must work together to stop gaming toxicity.
						</p>

						<p>
							Before developers decide that putting resources in fighting toxicity is a waste of time, or gamers believe that toxicity is not worth changing, 
							they should ask themselves what community they want: a "boy's club" where being toxic, especially to women and minorities, is the norm, 
							causing it to spread between players and cause it to be more normalized, and harming the self esteem and anxiety of people, especially that of young adults, 
							or a diverse and positive space where everyone can have fun, be safe, and succeed if they are skilled, regardless of their identity, 
							leading to a better reputation and environment for games and the people involved in making and playing them, along with better mental health for everyone.
